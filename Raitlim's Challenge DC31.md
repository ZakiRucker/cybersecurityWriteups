This challenge was presented to me while I was in LINECON 31. It was presented as a card, double-sided. 

The front was a picture of what looked like a wheel of cards and lines connecting them. http://minervallux.com/includes/rc2023_card_front.jpg?hollow=owoosj

The back was a an unknown phrase and an encoded message. http://minervallux.com/includes/rc2023_card_back.jpg?prophet=hvqglxl
The phrase:
	Ziqbtqu'a Kpittmvom LK31
	Cvivaemzml ycmabqwva jmkswv
	eqbpqv iv mqopbp xchhtmumvb
	mvkcjml amkzmba tqm qv eiqb
	lqdctoml wvtg bw bpm iabcbm.
	Qttcuqvibm bpm xibp jmtwe
	bw zmdmit i vme kwvcvlzcu.

There were two things that caught my attention. The apostrophe a in the first word could be a possessive apostrophe s in English. Additionally the LK31 at the end of the first line could be DC31. Since I was in line at DEF CON 31 this second guess was pretty likely correct. Since LK both happen to be 18 characters from DC I decided to move forward with running the entire message through a ROT13 tool, https://rot13.com, set to offset 18. Jackpot!
